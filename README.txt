WELCOME TO THE APPPICKER ARTICLE CHECKER UTILITY v0.1.2!

This readme contains a list of FEATURES and simple INSTRUCTIONS. You can review this content again at any time by selecting "Features and Instructions" in the "ArticleChecker" folder from your Windows Start menu.

FEATURES

Article Checker reads appPicker, iTunes, and Google Analytics for data about our apps.

All reports are saved to .csv files to allow easy management and any further analysis to your heart's content.

- Read all the apps directly off any number of applists -- 2,000 applists to check? No problem!

- Read all the apps from just one applist article ID

- Also get the iTunes links that are published on the articles - unrecognized link formats are highlighted

- Query iTunes for any number of apps for availability, quality, price, etc -- 2,000 applists have 200,000 apps to check? Yessir!

- Query Google Analytics for any number of articles (not just applists) for essential performance data -- don't be a mug clicking through dates, metrics, dimensions, and URLs in the Google Analytics admin panel itself!

INSTRUCTIONS

There are two ways to use this utility:

1. Command line. This is the initial mode when you start the utility from Windows. Start any function by typing its name and pressing ENTER. To list the names, type "help" and press ENTER. Quit by entering "exit".

2. Simple main menu. This is accessed from the command line mode (#1 above). After you start the utility from Windows, type "start" and press ENTER. Quit back to command line mode by selecting option "x".

TIP #1: press the up- or down-arrow to scroll through old entries. This saves you from re-typing the same things over and over again.

TIP #2: force quit any function at any time by pressing CTRL-C (or simply close the utility completely).

TODO:

Option 1, scrapelist, should continue if article_id given no longer exists.

Option 1, scrapelist, does not seem to read first line if user indicates no header line.

Make functions more user-friendly by indicating what is the problem with input columns instead of just giving exception message.
